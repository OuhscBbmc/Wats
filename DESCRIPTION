Title: Wrap Around Time Series Graphics
Description: Wrap-around Time Series (WATS) plots for interrupted time series
    designs with seasonal patterns.
    Longitudinal trajectories are shown in both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    In many scenarios, a WATS plot more clearly shows the existence and effect size of
    of an intervention.
